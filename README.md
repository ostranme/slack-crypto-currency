Run Node app
```
$ node index.js
```

**Configuring Your Slash Command**

Start by adding a custom integration for a new slash command. In my case, I entered  /crypto and hit the Add Slash Command Integration button to go to the next page.

You can skip most of the fields for now, but you must enter the (1) Command, (2) URL, and make sure the (3) Method is POST.

For the URL, I am using a temporary URL from `ngrok`, which serves my localhost to a public URL.

**Optional: Using ngrok**

If you wish to use ngrok for your development too, download ngrok from https://ngrok.com, run it on terminal:

```
$ ngrok http 3000
```

Now youâ€™ve got a ngrok URLs for your local server. In this case, copy this URL, https://c17f617d.ngrok.io and paste it into the configuration setup.

Now, run the node code, then test your command on Slack client

```
$ node index.js
```
